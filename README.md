# Junior Programmer: Final Mission Checkpoint Project
Work in progress

This Project is a summary of my junnior programming path in Learn.Unity.

This project will include:
- Demonstration of abstraction
- Demonstration of inheritance
- Demonstration of polymorphism
- Demonstration of encapsulation

I will also try to include self learnt design patterns such as:
- Singleton to maintain data with the usage of Jasons
- Object Pooling
- Factory Design

As it will take a longer time then most of my project I will try to update this readme with random thoughts and relevant links.
Started working on this project at 12/07/2023


12/07 Update:
Adding My Project Design Document - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CBsrgPQF8RxY4wJE1XaK2s7aw0Ue4SJ-h46mQAG3uFM/edit?usp=sharing
- Added Basic player movement
- Added Camera follow
- Added logic for passthrough platform (in Unity and PlayerController's code)

13/07 Update:
Spent most of the day reading about abstracts and interfaces to make sure I make the game scaleable, so only a short update:
- Added a weapon that pivots around the character pointing at the mouse position
- fixed a bug that denied the player from jumping if he tried to down jump from the ground
