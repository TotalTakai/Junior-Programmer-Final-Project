# Junior Programmer: Final Mission Checkpoint Project
Work in progress

This Project is a summary of my junnior programming path in Learn.Unity.

This project will include:
Demonstration of abstraction
Demonstration of inheritance
Demonstration of polymorphism
Demonstration of encapsulation

I will also try to include self learnt design patterns such as:
- Singleton to maintain data with the usage of Jasons
- Object Pooling
- Factory Design

As it will take a longer time then most of my project I will try to update this readme with random thoughts and relevant links.
